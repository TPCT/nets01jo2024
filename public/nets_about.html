            <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span>Tired of remembering where and when you met certain people? Confused who&rsquo;s that name on the cards?&nbsp; With NETS&rsquo; calendar synch feature, new contacts will be linked to calendar events, and even if there are no scheduled events, NETS will geotag the contact exchange allowing you to track where and when you met.</li>
            <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span>Sometimes you are at public events and you don&rsquo;t want to share your cell number with everyone you meet, and to solve this problem, NETS allows you to set the cell number sharing feature on or off based on your preference.</li>
            <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span>Are your phone contacts flooded with people you don&rsquo;t know or have hardly been in touch with? NETS solves this by allowing you to keep those contacts only on the app and adding relevant contacts to your phone.</li>
            <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span>Tired of keeping track of contacts and their constantly changing details?
